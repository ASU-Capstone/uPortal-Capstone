## How to Use This Directory

The uportal-portlets-overlay/NotificationPortlet sub-module has the lesscss-maven-plugin configured.
You can apply custom styles to the Notification portlet by overlaying LESS files in this directory,
which will be compiled into CSS by the plugin.

You also have the option of overlaying .css files directly.
