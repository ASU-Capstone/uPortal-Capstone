##  CAS & Local Authentication
##  
##  The following is an example of configuring uPortal to use both CAS
##  and local user authentication (authentication by username and password
##  hash stored in the uPortal database).  It uses the UnionSecurityContext
##  to consider both these authentication methods and declares the required
##  tokens for all.  This approach requires the corresponding filter mappings
##  in web.xml (mapping both the CASValidateFilter and the StaticCasReceiptCacher
##  filter in front of the LoginServlet).
##
##  The bundled cas instance (http://localhost:8080/cas) also uses the user in
##  the uPortal database for authentication.
##

## This is the factory that supplies the concrete authentication class
root=org.jasig.portal.security.provider.UnionSecurityContextFactory
root.cas=org.jasig.portal.security.provider.cas.CasAssertionSecurityContextFactory
#root.cas=org.jasig.portal.security.provider.cas.clearpass.PasswordCachingCasAssertionSecurityContextFactory
root.simple=org.jasig.portal.security.provider.SimpleSecurityContextFactory

## Answers what tokens are examined in the request for each context during authentication.
## A subcontext only needs to set its tokens if it differs from those of the root context.
principalToken.root=userName
credentialToken.root=password
credentialToken.root.cas=ticket

## Answers where the user will be redirected when log out occurs. Each security context can have one.
## (See comments in the LogoutController class)
## It would be better to escape the value of the url parameter, but since there are no parameters on the
## unescaped URL and since there are no further parameters on the logout URL, this does work.
logoutRedirect.root=${environment.build.cas.protocol}://${environment.build.cas.server}/cas/logout?url=${environment.build.uportal.protocol}://${environment.build.uportal.server}${environment.build.uportal.context}/Login

## This is the factory that supplies the concrete authorization class
authorizationProvider=org.jasig.portal.security.provider.AuthorizationServiceFactoryImpl

## Login URL, if specified the CLogin channel will display a Login link with
## this URL instead of the standard userName/password form.
org.jasig.portal.channels.CLogin.CasLoginUrl=${environment.build.cas.protocol}://${environment.build.cas.server}/cas/login?service=${environment.build.uportal.protocol}://${environment.build.uportal.server}${environment.build.uportal.context}/Login

## URL of the CAS clearPass password service.  Note that value must also be listed in the CAS Service Registry as an
## allowed URL to access the password.
org.jasig.portal.security.provider.cas.clearpass.PasswordCachingCasAssertionSecurityContextFactory.clearPassCasUrl=${environment.build.cas.protocol}://${environment.build.cas.server}/cas/clearPass

## Flag to determine if the portal should convert CAS assertion attributes to user attributes - defaults to false
#org.jasig.portal.security.cas.assertion.copyAttributesToUserAttributes=true

##  Local Only Authentication
##  
##  The following is an example of configuring uPortal local user authentication
##  (authentication by username and password hash stored in the uPortal database).
##
##  Comment out all other properties in this file and then uncomment the lines
##  prefixed with a single # below.
## 

## This is the factory that supplies the concrete authentication class
#root=org.jasig.portal.security.provider.SimpleSecurityContextFactory

## Answers what tokens are examined in the request for each context during authentication.
#principalToken.root=userName
#credentialToken.root=password

## This is the factory that supplies the concrete authorization class
#authorizationProvider=org.jasig.portal.security.provider.AuthorizationServiceFactoryImpl

## This property must be defined, but empty, when local-only authentication is used to satisfy bean configuration
## of RequireValidSessionFilter.java, or you can edit contexts/mvcContext.xml to not pass in this property
#org.jasig.portal.channels.CLogin.CasLoginUrl=


##
##  Multiple LDAP & Local Authentication
##  
##  The following is an example of configuring uPortal to use multiple LDAP
##  directories  and local user authentication (authentication by username and
##  password hash stored in the uPortal database).  It uses the UnionSecurityContext
##  to consider all authentication methods and declares the required tokens for all. 
##
##  Comment out all other properties in this file and then uncomment the lines
##  prefixed with a single # below.
## 

## This is the factory that supplies the concrete authentication class
#root=org.jasig.portal.security.provider.UnionSecurityContextFactory
#root.simple=org.jasig.portal.security.provider.SimpleSecurityContextFactory
#root.ldap_stu=org.jasig.portal.security.provider.SimpleLdapSecurityContextFactory
#root.ldap_fac=org.jasig.portal.security.provider.SimpleLdapSecurityContextFactory

## The following tells the SimpleLdapSecurityContextFactory with the similarly named
## property which named LDAP connection to use. Named LDAP connections are defined in
## properties/contexts/ldapContext.xml
#securityContextProperty.root.ldap_stu.connection=Students
#securityContextProperty.root.ldap_fac.connection=Faculty

## Answers what tokens are examined in the request for each context during authentication.
#principalToken.root=userName
#credentialToken.root=password

## This is the factory that supplies the concrete authorization class
#authorizationProvider=org.jasig.portal.security.provider.AuthorizationServiceFactoryImpl

## This property must be defined, but empty, when local-only authentication is used to satisfy bean configuration
## of RequireValidSessionFilter.java, or you can edit contexts/mvcContext.xml to not pass in this property
#org.jasig.portal.channels.CLogin.CasLoginUrl=
