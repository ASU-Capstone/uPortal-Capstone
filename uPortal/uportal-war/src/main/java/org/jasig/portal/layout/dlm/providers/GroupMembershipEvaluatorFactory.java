/**
 * Creates a group membership evaluator. This class inherits from
 * IPersonEvaluatorFactory. Subclassing IPersonEvaluatorFactory gives us all
 * benefits of its configuration language structure. The side affect of course
 * is then that our group evaluator must be configured with that language
 * structure. The definitions of the specific, non-element-containing evaluators
 * must conform to the following element structure:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 
 *   &lt; attribute mode=&quot;required&quot; 
 *     name=&quot;required&quot; 
 *     value=&quot;optional&quot;/ &gt;
 *  
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Therefore, the form selected for our group membership evaluator
 * configurations is:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 
 *   &lt; attribute mode=&quot;memberOf&quot; name=&quot;Students&quot;/ &gt; 
 *  
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Case is important for both mode and name. The value attribute is not used in
 * configuration of these group membership evaluators.
