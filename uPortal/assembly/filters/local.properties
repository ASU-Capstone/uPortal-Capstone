#==================== Maven Filtering ========================
# You can use this file to manage environment-specific settings and supply them 
# to the appropriate locations at build time.  This process uses a Maven feature 
# called "Filtering" (http://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-filtering/).
#
# Place filter tokens for environment-specific settings in configuration files, 
# then provide values for those tokens below.  NOTE:  Files with filter tokens 
# MUST be listed in the <includes> section for filtering in the appropriate 
# pom.xml file.

# Use 'filters.file' to override the location of the properties file for 
# Maven filtering.  The specified location should be a RELATIVE PATH.  If not 
#specified, this file (build.properties or build.{env}.properties) will be used.
#filters.file=filters/prod.properties
