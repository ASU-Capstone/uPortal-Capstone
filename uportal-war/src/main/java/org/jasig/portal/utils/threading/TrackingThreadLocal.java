/**
 * A ThreadLocal subclass that keeps track of all created instances. Using this ThreadLocal
 * subclass in uPortal allows any portlet execution thread wrapped by
 * {@link TrackingThreadLocalPortletExecutionInterceptor} to have the values copied into the
 * appropriate ThreadLocals in the child thread when the thread is run. This avoids having
 * to write explicit code for each ThreadLocal that needs to be copied.<br><br>  
 * 
 * The references kept the the ThreadLocal instances is done using a weak set so this tracking
 * subclass will not cause leaks by holding on to thread local instances that are no longer
 * referenced.
