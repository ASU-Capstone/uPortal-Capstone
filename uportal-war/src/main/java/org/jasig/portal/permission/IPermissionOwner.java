 * IPermissionOwner represents the owner of a set of permission activities.  
 * Permission owners in uPortal may be thought of as a kind of category of
 * permissions or as a system which owns a set of permissions that are unrelated
 * to those of other permission owners.
 * 
 * Examples of permission owners might include a subsystem in the portal such
 * as the set of permissions for subscribing to uPortal portlets or a portlet
 * running outside the portal's application context.
 * 
 * Each permission owner registers a set of permission "activities", which 
 * enumerate the permission activities the owner expects to manage.
 * 
 * The IPermissionOwner interface replaces the IPermissible interface as of
 * the uPortal 3.3 release.
