        NOTE:  The default skin for Respondr is available in three variations:

          1. static (enabled by default)
                Links compiled LESS (i.e. CSS) into the page using the Dynamic Skin Portlet when using the
                following configuration specified by portlet preferences in portlet.xml

                dynamic: false
                skinName: defaultSkin (may be changed to the institutional skin's name file by changing the
                          preference in the portlet definition file dynamic-respondr-skin.portlet-definition.xml
                          or changing the preference value using the Manage Portlets UI). Will embed
                          defaultSkin.css (name derived by adding ".css" to skinName).
          2. static using skin.xml
                Does not use the Dynamic Skin Portlet at all.  Typically used at a non-tenant institution that
                customized their theme or skin.  You must change skin.xml to include your
                institution CSS skin file, remove Dynamic Skin Manager from respondr-lo.fragment-layout.xml and
                re-import the fragment layout, and change the skin name set in
                src/main/data/required_entities/stylesheet-descriptor/Respondr.stylesheet-descriptor.xml
          3. dynamic
                Generates a customized CSS file from the defaultSkin LESS file, incorporating user-configured
                portlet preference values for configurable elements (mostly colors). Dynamic Skin Portlet links
                customized CSS file into the page.  To use, set the following preference values in the
                portlet definition file dynamic-respondr-skin.portlet-definition.xml:

                dynamic: true
                skinName: Optional (defaults to defaultSkin).  Base name of the LESS file to look for in
                          media/skins/respondr to process (.less added to the base name).  For example, value
                          of defaultSkin will process defaultSkin.less to create the dynamic skin css file.

        All flavors use exactly the same LESS files.  The dynamic strategy supports changing a few settings
        (i.e. color choices) using an admin UI.  You can switch from one strategy to the other by adjusting
        configuration as indicated above.

        Creating institution-specific theme/skin.
        1. Copy defaultSkin folder to a name of your choice (e.g. byuSkin)
        2. Copy defaultSkin.less to a similar name; e.g. byuSkin.less
        3. Customize skin files accordingly.
        4. Modify this file to your institution skin name (e.g. change defaultSkin to byuSkin)
        5. Enable dynamic skin portlet and set skinName to your institution name (see above).
