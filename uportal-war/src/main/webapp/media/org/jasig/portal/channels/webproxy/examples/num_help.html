<font size=+1><b>Numguess Help</b></font>

<p>
This version of Numguess is running (or trying to run) your local Tomcat
numguess.jsp.  It assumes the URL is http://localhost:8080/examples/jsp/num/numguess.jsp.  Note that localhost refers to the host your uPortal instance is
running on, not the machine your browser is on.

<p>
The channel uses CWebProxy to incorporate the numguess application.
CWebProxy is invoked with the following parameters:
<table>
 <tr align=left>
  <td><b>Name</b></td>
  <td><b>Value</b></td>
 </tr>
 <tr align=left>
  <td>cw_xml</td>
  <td>http://localhost:8080/examples/jsp/num/numguess.jsp</td>
 </tr>
 <tr align=left>
  <td>cw_ssl</td>
  <td>webpages/stylesheets/org/jasig/portal/channels/CWebProxy/XHTML.ssl</td>
 </tr>
 <tr align=left>
  <td>cw_info</td>
  <td>examples/num_info.html</td>
 </tr>
 <tr align=left>
  <td>cw_help</td>
  <td>examples/num_help.html</td>
 </tr>
 <tr align=left>
  <td>cw_edit</td>
  <td>examples/num_edit.html</td>
 </tr>
 <tr align=left>
  <td>cw_passThrough</td>
  <td>all</td>
 </tr>
 <tr align=left>
  <td>cw_tidy</td>
  <td>on</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p>

This help page is a static html page on a remote server, with the URL
indicated by the <i>cw_help</i> parameter.  CWebProxy replaces the application
with this URL when you click on the help button, so we need to aim you
back to the original application when you're done with help.  This is
done by using a special runtime parameter <b>cw_reset</b> with a value
of <b>return</b>.  It could also be done by setting cw_xml to point back
to the original application.

<p>
Note that if the <i>cw_xml</i>URL gets set to something that doesn't work,
there's currently no way for CWebProxy to return to the application.

<!--
Note to authors:
try: /examples... instead of localhost.
need to get an rendering exception thrown if problem getting at xml for
a button.
